    text: "Imagine a town with 11,000 population where people do not have anything to do! People do not have many interests because there is literally nothing to do. There were couple of grocery stores for the whole town. Moreover there were no malls, no movie theaters, no parks (even for children). That is the town where I grew up. Growing up I had one interest which was girls... That is understandable because whenever you have nothing to do, that is the only thing that you end up doing! It was going on for a long time... Until one day I got sick and started reading because I was bored. There were no big libraries with new books. The only one we had was a leftover from soviet union with the oldest books. So what I decided to do is get online books and read them. This is the start of my personality transformation. I fell in love with books. Since I did not have much choice I was reading everyting that I could put my hands on. It was going on for some time... Then I met one guy accidentally who was also interested in reading and we became a good friends. He was sharing some books with me because he had access to them(they had wifi at their house, we did not). So he was downloading them and sharing with me. Then we switched to movies. Once he shared with me documentary about Facebook and Microsoft! After watching the movie I wanted to try myself in coding. Downloaded SoloLearn and started playing around with it! I loved it and it became my hobbie! Since then I have been going on and off with coding... The reason why I was going off is because I did not have access even to free stuff out there. Because we did not have internet.. Even the one that we did was extremely expensive.. So I was looking for wifi as a kid and if I could find them I would go to the neighborhood of the house try to hack their wifi password via some apps and then download some free classes from youtube. Internet was so slow that I had to wait hours to download 100+ Mb videos... It was tricky because, you also should not get caught to the wifi owners.. Because if they catch you, they would change their password and we wouldn't have had even what you did have in the moment. So I was going there at nights and just leave my phone somewhere outside, thoroughly hidden. Sometimes I was my phone it even for the whole night! That is how I kept my hobby alive until I went to college. In 2018, I graduated from high school and applied for college in St. Petersburg, Russia. I was so thrilled to come here and study... But more than that I was ecstatic about the ability to access information easily... Coming to Russia I wanted to learn everything at once, because I had a feeling that I was missing out. So I was trying to learn all the languages at once... I remember picking Java, Python, Javascript, C++, php and some others... I was overwhelmed with information.. I did not have plan.. So I did quit, because I did not know where I was going. Year later I started learning again but this time I have decided to learn web development first and then move on to something else. I have started refreshing my memory. Then Pandemic hit and so many resources online were made free for month.. I did take them and started learning everythin.. Thus I knew about React and took couple of React classes on Pluralsight. I have been coding on React ever since! I love it and always try to keep up with trends!",
